      <p class="blog-post-meta"> 2014年7月25日 <a href="../pdf/20140725_PrevalenceAwarenessTreatment.pdf" target="_blank"> Full text / 全文 </a></p>
      <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
		<p>Awareness of hypertension, as well as its prevalence, treatment, and control status, has not been comprehensively investigated in Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR), China. </p>
		<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
		<p>A survey was conducted on a randomly sampled population of 1,410 participants (n = 638 men) aged 18–93 years in 2012. Blood pressure was individually measured twice. Awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension were assessed by interview-administered questionnaire. </p>
		<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
		<p>Prevalence of hypertension was 34% in Macau, similar to the United States (30%) and United Kingdom (31%). Among hypertensives, 69% were aware of their condition, 59% were treated, and 30% were adequately controlled. Older age (≥50 years; odds ratio (OR) = 5.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.6–6.1), being of the male sex (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.9–2.5), having retired (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.8–2.3), being married (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.3–1.9), having a low level of education in women (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1–2.1), Pinteraction = 0.01), and lack of salt awareness (OR = 1.1; 95% CI = 1.0–1.3) were associated with hypertension. Older age, having retired, and being married were also associated with higher awareness and treatment rates. Those who were older and married were better controlled. These demographic factors differed by sex. Those who had some knowledge of salt intake were more likely to have higher hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rates. </p>
		<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
		<p>The prevalence of hypertension in Macau in 2012 has increased com- pared with 2006 (28%) and is comparable with prevalence rates in developed countries. Specific health promotion campaigns related to knowledge of risk factors such as salt intake and smoking may be useful for hypertension prevention and to improve hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rates. </p>
